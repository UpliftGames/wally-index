Fork Modification Info: BridgeNet doesn't maintain server to client event firing order, so this is a small fork that adds that. It works by sending a secondary time value with every 'content' data packet that's fired from the server, then reorders them on the client using that value before the connected bridge callbacks are invoked.","license":"MIT","authors":[],"include":[],"exclude":[],"private":false},"place":{"shared-packages":null,"server-packages":null},"dependencies":{"RemotePacketSizeCounter":"pysephwasntavailable/remotepacketsizecounter@>=2.1.0, <3.0.0","TableKit":"ffrostflame/tablekit@>=0.2.4, <0.3.0","wallyInstanceManager":"ffrostflame/wally-instance-manager@>=0.1.0, <0.2.0"},"server-dependencies":{},"dev-dependencies":{}}
